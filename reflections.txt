What skills have I learned?
Wow, I feel like I've spent so much time on HTML, more time than allotted, and feel like I've only gain an inch. From learning about <a>, href, <strong>, <img>, src, <ul>, <il>, etc. I have gained some skills that I'm becoming mroe curious now to press CTRL+SHFT+I to get the web developer tools, but I feel like that's been taking away from my N.D. 
What has been difficult? 
What has been easy? 
The videos are just to easy, I kind of wish they'd go into more detail, have some structure to it, and not have to pause to take notes every five seconds.
The most difficult thing has been learning the teaching style from Udacity, and adapting myself to that learning style to become a more effective student. Further, I'm not sure on the specific instruction given by the Instructors of the course, and it is a little challenging because they talk really fast trying to get as much info in a short clip on YouTube. I have to pause and rewind and put Closed Caption on to get all of what they are saying. 
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far? 
I have thought back to the note to self, and realized where I was and what a great opportunity I've been given as a Transcend Award recipient.
